# Capstone Project - Data Analysis of Laha Electronics Shop

## Business Overview:

This data analysis report focuses on Laha Electronics, a retail electronics shop owned by Mr. Dinabandhu Laha, located in West Bengal. The shop has been operating successfully for over 27 years. Laha Electronics primarily sells TVs, home theatre systems, radios, charger lights, fans, mixer grinders, induction ovens, and irons.

## Data Collection:

For this project, sales data was collected from daily records kept in a diary. As there was no proper book maintained for record-keeping, the data had to be cleaned and structured by working closely with Mr. Dinabandhu Laha. Approximately 30 days' worth of data, starting from October 4, 2021, was structured and organized in Excel sheets.

## Analysis Highlights:

* <code>"Volume Pareto Chart and Revenue Pareto Chart"</code> : Visualized the distribution of sales volume and revenue across different sold items to identify the top-performing products.
* <code>"Scatter Plot"</code> : Utilized to identify outliers and gain insights into fast-moving products.
* <code>"Chart on Sold and Bought Items"</code> : Analyzed the pattern of sold and bought items to understand stock movement.
* <code>"Average Profit and Total Profit Chart"</code> : Examined the average and total profits generated by the shop.
* <code>"Revenue Growth Chart"</code> : Visualized the growth of revenue over time.
* <code>"Day-wise Revenue and Number of Sold Items Chart"</code> : Explored the most active shop days based on revenue and number of sales.

## Recommendations:

* <code>"Increase Stock for Profitable Items"</code> : Based on the analysis, it is recommended to stock up more on TVs, home theatre systems, and mixers, as they have shown to be high-profit items.
* <code>"Embrace Digital Payment Options"</code> : Given the preference for mobile payments, it is suggested to set up a merchant account on platforms such as Google Pay or Paytm to facilitate online transactions and potentially increase sales.
* <code>"Optimize Shop Operating Days"</code> : The analysis reveals that the shop experiences higher revenue and profit on Tuesdays and Fridays. Therefore, it is advisable to keep the shop open on these days to capitalize on increased customer demand.

By implementing these recommendations, Laha Electronics can enhance profitability, improve customer convenience, and maximize revenue potential.
